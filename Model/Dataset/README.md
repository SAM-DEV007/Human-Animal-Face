# Dataset

The following instructions has to be followed to properly place the dataset:
- Download the dataset from [here]().
- Extract the `.zip` file in the `Dataset` folder.
- The directory should be as follows:
  - Dataset
    - test
    - train

If a new folder, let's say A, is created after extraction which contains `train` and `test` folder in it, copy and paste both the folders (`train` and `test`)
out of A inside `Dataset` folder and delete the folder A. Make sure to match the directory with that given above.
